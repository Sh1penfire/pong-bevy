# pong-bevy
An implementation of Pong in bevy made for the purpose of learning Bevy. Lots of mistakes have been made.
Features a window with two rectangle pong paddles and a ball. The ball bounces off paddles at an angle, and upon hitting either the left or right sides of the screen, bounces toward the middle of the window (Because I have no idea how to do fonts yet)

## Controlls
-Player 1: s and w for down and up

-Player 2: l and o for down and up
